# Bridge pattern

- Separate abstraction from its implementation.

- Abstraction (also called interface) is a high-level control layer for some entity. This layer isnâ€™t supposed to do any real work on its own. It should delegate the work to the implementation layer (also called platform).

- Helps to flatten the proliferation of classes whenever a new specialization of the abstraction or a new platform is added. From (m \* n) to (m + n)

- Abstraction(interface) hierarchy can grow independently from the platform hierarchy(implementation)

- The independent concepts could also referred to as: abstraction/platform, domain/infrastructure, front-end/back-end or interface/implementation.

## Implementation notes

- Often interface/abstraction contains a handle to the concrete implementation.
- To instantiate the right concrete implementation, interface/abstraction uses abstract factory.
- Client always interacts with the interface only.
