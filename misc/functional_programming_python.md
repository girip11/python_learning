# Functional programming in python

* **Pure functions** - accepts input and returns output without modifying the state of the system.
* **Immutability** - cannot change the object's state once it is created. Ex: String and tuple in python are immutable.
* **Higher order functions** - Functions that can accept another function as input parameter and return a function as output. For instance, `map` and `filter` are examples of higher order functions.

* List comprehensions can be used as alternative to the lambdas, `map` and `filter` functions.
